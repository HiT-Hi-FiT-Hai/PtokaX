PtokaX need for compiling packages (and url where to find sources when package is not available in your OS):
    g++				(name in Debian)    |   http://gcc.gnu.org/
    make			(name in Debian)    |   http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
    liblua5.1 + liblua5.1-dev   (names in Debian)   |   http://www.lua.org
    zlib1g + zlib1g-dev         (names in Debian)   |   http://zlib.net
    TinyXml                                         |   http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml

PtokaX was tested on debian where g++, make, lua and zlib was available as packages.

TinyXml is missing in Debian, makefile for it is with PtokaX source in tinyxml directory.
For TinyXml compiling unpack files tinystr.cpp tinystr.h tinyxml.cpp tinyxml.h tinyxmlerror.cpp tinyxmlparser.cpp to tinyxml/src directory
and after run make (or gmake when GNU make is not default in your OS) from tinyxml directory.

For compiling PtokaX run make (or gmake when GNU make is not default in your OS) from PtokaX directory.
