PtokaX need for compiling packages (and url where to find sources when package is not available in your OS):
    g++									(name in Debian)    |   http://gcc.gnu.org/
    make								(name in Debian)    |   http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
    liblua5.2 + liblua5.2-dev			(names in Debian)   |   http://www.lua.org
    zlib1g + zlib1g-dev					(names in Debian)   |   http://zlib.net
    libtinyxml2.6.2 + libtinyxml-dev	(names in Debian)	|   http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml
    The Skein Hash Function Family                     		|   http://www.skein-hash.info/

PtokaX was tested on debian where g++, make, lua (it can be any 5.2.x version, but in debian they always use only 5.2 in name), zlib and tinyxml is available as packages.

For compiling PtokaX run make lua52 (or gmake lua52 when GNU make is not default in your OS) from PtokaX directory.

Compile guides for different Operating Systems are available in PtokaX Wiki http://wiki.ptokax.org/doku.php?id=guides.
